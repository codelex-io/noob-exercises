# Easy Exercises

Exercises in this directory are programming challenges.

To complete these exercises you will need to modify the `index.ts` file in each subdirectory of `src` so that the given function returns the correct value.

To verify that your code works, for each exercise we have written tests using a popular library - [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Your goal is to make all tests pass or, in other words, make them all green.

## Getting Ready

Open this folder (`03-easy`) in the Visual Studio Code and download all the dependencies by executing `npm install` from the VS Code's terminal.

## Executing Tests

`src` directory includes multiple subdirectories. Each of them contains two files, one contains the code that you are going to modify and the second one is a test file which you are not allowed to modify.

Start in the ascending order, by looking at the **code and test** (it is very important to read the test also) try to figure out what you need to do.

Execute all tests with command `npm test`

You will see that there are a lot of tests being run and most of them are failing (red).

Afterwards, the process will stay running and you will be presented with a few options, choose `o` to run only the tests related to changed files.

Now when you change any file, tests related to that file will be run (it will happen automatically, if you have autosave enabled).

If you want to exit from currently running process press `ctrl + c`.
